# Tests
The solution with tests, which I hope will help me to understand CLR and C# better.

## BoxingAndUnboxing project
### StringTester.cs
Seems like there is no any difference in performance if ToString executed with boxing or without boxing.
### ArrayTester.cs
There is a strange difference in execution time of TestStringArrayWtihConcat and TestStringArrayWtihoutConcat.
